This is the repositry of group mustard's project

I have uploaded the Form version of the programme. This is a work in progress as it has taken some time to get the code to work with the 
forms. I have also tried to clean the console code away from this branch and only include the form code. - Matt 26/03/2021

Some slight additions have been made, bug fixes and some quality of life changes. - Matt 27/03/2021

Added a counter that will show the user how many correct and incorrect answers the user has inputted 
during the test. - Matt 27/03/21

The hiragana constructors are done and a version of the test is ready however, some changes need to be made as the test button is missing the stage asking the user
what test they want to do. I will do that soon. - Matt 29/03/2021


The tests will now have two seperate mode that will include a version that has the hiragana symbols and a full version that will have ALL possilbe hiragana
characters. Also added better of quality of life for tests - they will not repeat the content, found this meant the tests went on too long. - Matt 02/04/2021

Created a kanji lesson. I used 18 panels to do and I found visual studio get VERY lagy with this method so I will need to find or ask for another method as I like that 
it doesn't create new forms and makes the user experience smooth however they may be a way to avoid this via code, I will have to look or ask a lecturer (Beth or Tina).
The lesson is made a rough testing has taken place, just need to add it to the documentation. - Matt 05/04/2021

The kanji Lesson test has been implamented. Had an issue with commiting the test form cs file as git would not add it to the commit. I fixed this but just changing the code 
(i added a extra line so nothing major) - Matt 23/04/2021
