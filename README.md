# Project-Project-Repo
This is the repositry of group mustard's project

I have added an introduction to the programme in a seperate cs file using another method to help seperate it - It needs some more testing but I will create a test plan for it at a later date - Matt 23/02/21

The comments have been updated to be a little more clearer and a test plan is finished and ready to be used - Matt

I have finished making the main menu code. It just needs testing to make sure it works formally (i mean it needs to be tested through a proper test plan). The test plan needs to be created still.
This also needs to be tested that it works with the previous function properly as well. - Matt 01/03/2021

I have made most of the Hiragana function that splits off into 5 lessons. Still working on the lessons and how the main loop within the tests of those lessons will work. I have a design
but getting it to work within code is currently my issue. - Matt 04/03/2021

I have made the main card shuffling loop. The first lesson within hiragana has been done. There a few issues that need ironing out
but right now the main part of the project is done. - Matt 10/03/2021
