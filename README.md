# Project-Project-Repo
This is the repositry of group mustard's project

I have uploaded the Form version of the programme. This is a work in progress as it has taken some time to get the code to work with the 
forms. I have also tried to clean the console code away from this branch and only include the form code. - Matt 26/03/2021

Some slight additions have been made, bug fixes and some quality of life changes. - Matt 27/03/2021

Added a counter that will show the user how many correct and incorrect answers the user has inputted 
during the test. - Matt 27/03/21

The hiragana constructors are done and a version of the test is ready however, some changes need to be made as the test button is missing the stage asking the user
what test they want to do. I will do that soon. - Matt 29/03/2021


The tests will now have two seperate mode that will include a version that has the hiragana symbols and a full version that will have ALL possilbe hiragana
characters. Also added better of quality of life for tests - they will not repeat the content, found this meant the tests went on too long. - Matt 02/04/2021

Created a kanji lesson. I used 18 panels to do and I found visual studio get VERY lagy with this method so I will need to find or ask for another method as I like that 
it doesn't create new forms and makes the user experience smooth however they may be a way to avoid this via code, I will have to look or ask a lecturer (Beth or Tina).
The lesson is made a rough testing has taken place, just need to add it to the documentation. - Matt 05/04/2021

The kanji Lesson test has been implamented. Had an issue with commiting the test form cs file as git would not add it to the commit. I fixed this but just changing the code 
(i added a extra line so nothing major) - Matt 23/04/2021

Kanji Lesson 1 Test has been fixed. I will need to finish the whole test for the kanji to include lesson 2 content but as of right now the 
test button now actually gives you a test. Right now the score system has been implamented for the hiragana tests, as of right now I have no plans to implament 
this feature for the kanji tests (though it would be better if I did). - Matt 26/04/2021

Changed the Hiragana Lesson 2 and onwards buttons don't work. Updated the buttons to show they are not finished. - Matt 04/05/2021

Started adding kristiyans code to the project. - 05/05/2021 - Matt 05/05/2021

Finished the implamentation - Its not perfect but its functionality is mostly there. - Matt 07/05/2021

Finished the Hiragana Lesson 2 and fixed an issue the weak area method was causing with lesson tests. - 09/05/2021
Finished the Hiragana Lesson 3.

Finished Hiragana lesson 4. This method was by copying the format of the last lesson and changing the code and the designer code to match the correct content.
This works better than hand making them - This works as the lesson format is the same anyway. - 11/05/2021
